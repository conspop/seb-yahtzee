### How to Play Yahtzee For One
1. Click or tap green Roll Bar (or press Space if using a keyboard) to roll dice.
2. Click or tap dice to freeze them before role.
3. Click or tap scoring box to record score.
4. If you roll a 2nd Yahtzee (Yahtzee Bonus), click on the box you wish to score and your Yahtzee Bonus will be added to the Yahtzee score.
5. When game is over, click blue New Game bar to start over.

### Notes On High Score and Avg Score
- Your high and average score are tracked on your device. 
- Both are updated at the end of the game or on a refresh of the page.
- Once a score has been recorded, the current game is included in the average score. In other words, if you record 6 in your threes box and then refresh tthe game, a score of 6 would be included in your average score.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Add database so:
  - Users' history (statistics) can be tracked more permanently and on different devices.
  - Extend the number of datapoints included in statistics, ie. average for each box, global leaderboard, etc.
2. Add multiple game functionality so that user can play a true 6 round game.
